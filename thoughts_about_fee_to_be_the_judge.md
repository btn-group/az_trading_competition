# Fee to be the judge

There should be a fee to be the judge, this is to stop people being the judge and then not doing the job.

- Should there be a fee to apply to be the next judge?
	- Yes because the judge update role can be called by anyone.
	- It should be the entry fee
- What happens when the user fails to do the job?
	- I was gonna say that it should goto the next person, but that's no good beacuse it can be abused.
	- I was gonna say that it should be sent to the admin, what's wrong with that? I guess it means the admin can abuse it.
	- It could get wrapped up and shared with all the competitors...
		- This is probably the best way tp handle it.
- What happens when the user does the job?
	- They should get the amount sent back to them.
- The amount should be the entry fee / token...
